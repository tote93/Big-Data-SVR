**Abstract**   
This  bachelor  project  aims  to  detect  the  occupation  of  Intelligent  Building  (IB),  and  SmartHome, optimizing energy waste using data obtained from indirect methods. The leading causeof this project is that most of the software developed for this purpose is based on detecting theoccupation of the room using invasive methods. 
Therefore, to determine the presence of peo-ple without being invasive, the use of indirect methods has been determined.
So that, it will determine the prediction of the CO2 waveform based on the use of sensorsthat measure indoor/outdoor temperature and relative humidity.  
To predict the occupancy,the method used is Support Vector Regression (SVR).
